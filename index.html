				<span class = "highlight">Effects of Bias</span><br><br>
				Bias can be a <span class = "emphasis">hindrance to truth</span>. When raw truth becomes tainted by the political opinions of the reporter, the memories of the historian, or the worldview of the experimenter, <span class = "emphasis">truth is tarnished</span>. And how can we go about our daily lives with the knowledge of a false truth? <br><br> In 1887, Jose Rizal published Noli Me Tangere. His words touched the hearts of aching Filipinos and spurred them to break free from Spanish colonial rule. The Spaniards executed Rizal for his words of truth in 1896. Two world wars and a century later, at a time where ideas move at the speed of light, <span class = "emphasis">the power of words has been defiled</span>. By deliberately twisting facts or carelessly letting opinions seep into fact, wrong ideas are propagated. It is up to us readers to <span class = "emphasis">stay vigilant and critical</span>, to guard our thoughts, which spur our actions and impact our lives. </td>
