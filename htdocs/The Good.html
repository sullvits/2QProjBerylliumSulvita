				An <span class = "emphasis">editorial or opinion article</span> is an <span class = "emphasis">opinionated news story</span> written by a member of the editorial board of a newspaper. The editor doesn't just rant their opinions to the public. Rather, they present a timely news story and a clear, fact-supported argument, much like a thesis. Naturally, the editor is allowed to show their bias in an editorial article, because their purpose is to persuade people to believe what they believe. They get the freedom to piece together news stories and make sense of current events in their own perspective. Us readers must <span class = "emphasis">choose for ourselves</span> whether we side with the editor or not.<br><br>
			
				Most editorial articles have a disclaimer at the bottom saying that the publication does not affiliate itself with the editor's views, but this is not always true<br><br>

				In just one week, a General accused several celebrities and the Mayor of the country’s capital of supporting or giving aid to “communists”. A lot has been said on why it is improper for a general to say these things cavalierly. <br><br>
		
				I agree with most, if not all of these but, my concern is more agnostic – the <span class = "emphasis">systematic deployment of Red-tagging online endangers ALL of us</span>. Science tells us that red-tagging is one tool in a mind-conditioning arsenal whose effectivity traces back to the Holocaust (Yes, THAT Holocaust) and other tragic points in human history. Before I get red-tagged myself, allow me to explain. <br><br>
		
				Psychologists have studied why at certain points of history, people were able to commit unspeakable violence. After all, we are not born with the desire to be unkind or to kill. So, <span class = "emphasis">what makes atrocities and genocides possible?</span> <br><br>
		
				Part of the answer lies in Dehumanization studies. Dehumanization means “to deprive (someone or something) of human qualities, personality, or dignity” (Webster). Unlike humans, Objects can be broken, thrown or ignored. But, what if it’s possible to <span class = "emphasis">peel away the “humanity”</span> of a person or, an entire group of people? Can we train people to see others as “objects”?...

				"Blog" comes from the word <span class = "emphasis">"web-log"</span>. Blog posts present the author's ideas and experiences to <span class = "emphasis">spark conversation</span> between the author and the reader. They are personal, biased, and more anecdotal than factual. Often you'll see blogs have comment boxes at the bottom where readers interact with each other and with the author. Blogs are not like Twitter or Instagram posts. Twitter threads are not for productive conversation, but for virtual fistfights and mad roasts. Since blogs are possible sources of income, a serious blogger must keep their writing concise to attract readers. Bloggers have to always think of their target market. So if I were to post something like, "I hope *** dies this year", I'd go on Twitter, not on an informative blog that pays my bills. And if I were running a satirical blog, I'd be more creative — again, always thinking of the target market. <br><br>

				<span class = "emphasis">Why do we believe what we believe?</span><br>
			
				We’ve talked about a lot of ideas in this series so far, but a common theme that runs through most of them is <span class = "emphasis">human belief</span>. Our beliefs make up our perception of reality, they drive our behavior, and they shape our life stories. History happened the way it did because of what people believed in the past, and what we believe today will write the story of our future.<br>
			
				So it seems like an important question to ask: Why do we actually come to believe the things we end up believing?<br>
			
				To figure that out, we have to get good at seeing human thinking in 3D. By the time you finish Part 3, you’ll understand what I mean by that.<br>
            
				For now, let’s get used to seeing in 2D. That’s our mission in this chapter...

					Without bias, we would not have literature. To be able to <span class = "emphasis">express ourselves</span>, we need to use our <span class = "emphasis">unique opinions and biases</span> about this world. Yes, bias can be a good thing. Since bias is inherent in fiction, like all other examples here, it is never to be taken as hard fact. A novel doesn't need to come with a bibliography, because the author is the only citation it needs. Even historical fiction is not free from bias. The author does not want to be impartially truthful, but authentic. <br><br>
			
					Here is a Cliffsnotes summary of the classic novel, Lord of the Flies by William Golding.

				In Lord of the Flies, British schoolboys are stranded on a tropical island. In an attempt to recreate the culture they left behind, they elect Ralph to lead, with the intellectual Piggy as counselor. But Jack wants to lead, too, and one-by-one, he lures the boys from civility and reason to the savage survivalism of primeval hunters. In Lord of the Flies, William Golding gives us a glimpse of the <span class = "emphasis">savagery</span> that underlies even the <span class = "emphasis">most civilized human beings</span>.<br>
			
				The three most important aspects of Lord of the Flies:<br>
			
				<ul>
					<li> The major theme of Lord of the Flies is that humans are <span class = "emphasis">essentially barbaric</span> if not downright evil. The stranded boys begin by establishing a society similar to the one they left behind in England, but soon their society has degenerated into rival clans ruled by fear and violence; before the book is over, three boys have been killed. </li>
					<li> The novel is an <span class = "emphasis">allegory</span>, which is a story in which characters, settings, and events stand for things larger than themselves. For example, the island represents the world; Ralph and Jack symbolize different approaches to leadership. </li>
					<li> William Golding wrote Lord of the Flies <span class = "emphasis">following World War II</span>, during which the Nazis exterminated six million Jews and the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan. In this context, the novel's profound pessimism is understandable. </li>
				</ul>
