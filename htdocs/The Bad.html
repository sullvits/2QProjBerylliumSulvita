				<!--some background on the news story-->
				
				A few days before, the <span class = "emphasis">Presidential Security Guard</span> was reported to have recieved vaccines even though the FDA had <span class = "emphasis">not approved any vaccines</span> yet. There is no law that incriminates one who gets injected with an unapproved vaccine, but smuggling unapproved vaccines into the country is most certainly <span class = "emphasis">illegal</span>. The PSG confessed to the public that they--of their own accord--arranged to be vaccinated. The <span class = "emphasis">Congress</span> and the <span class = "emphasis">Senate</span> wished to call the PSG into their investigation on smuggled vaccines. But <span class = "emphasis">President Duterte reacted</span>.

				See the first two quotes below. ABS-CBN used these quotes in their report where the President seems to be <span class = "emphasis">indifferent</span> to the plight of his soldiers, seeking only his own survival. <br><br>
				
				<span class = "highlight"><a href = "ABSCBNTranscript.html#4">ABS-CBN</a></span><br>

				<p class = "transcript">Duterte: Hayaan mo silang mamatay kung mayroong masamang epekto yung--I don't know what kind of vaccine--<span class = "emphasis">I don't care</span>, bahala sila, buhay nila iyon. </p><br>

				<p class = "transcript">Duterte: <span class = "emphasis">How can I survive</span> if wala akong close-in to guard me... to prevent untoward, you know, incidents? Iyan ang problema diyan. </p><br>
				
				However, GMA used instead a different quote of Duterte where he seems to <span class = "emphasis">truly care</span> about his soldiers. See this quote below. <br><br>
				
				<span class = "highlight"><a href = "GMATranscript.html#11">GMA</a></span><br>
			
				<p class = "transcript">Duterte: The lives of these people--the lives of these soldiers--are <span class = "emphasis">placed on jeopardy</span>, because, walang choice eh. Trabaho nila 'yan. If the intelligence people would say, "Go to the crowd and mix with them, and maybe look for any hostile attitude or hostile act." Ang akin namang nakapalibot, babae't lalaki, hindi naman makalapit sa akin, kasi, "Sir, social distancing." How can they protect me if "social distancing"? </p><br>
				
				See the stark difference between the last two quotes, though they have essentially the same meaning. ABS-CBN's quote of Duterte has <span class = "emphasis">wrong grammar</span>, whereas GMA's quote of Duterte portrays him like a <span class = "emphasis">hero</span>. <br><br>
				
				<span class = "highlight"><a href = "ABSCBNTranscript.html#14">ABS-CBN</a></span><br>
				
				<p class = "transcript">Duterte: So what is there in legislation that you can make that has something to do with vaccine? You cannot legislate vaccine.</p><br>
			
				<span class = "highlight"><a href = "GMATranscript.html#8">GMA</a></span><br>
				
				<p class = "transcript">Duterte: I respect the separation of powers and that you have the right to conduct Congressional investigations--in aid of legislation. Tell me now, what aid that you can legislate? When there is no goddamn vaccine until now.</p><br>
				
				GMA picked quotes that <span class = "emphasis">paint Duterte in a good way</span>, while ABS-CBN picked quotes that <span class = "emphasis">paint Duterte in a bad way</span>. Both approaches are wrong. The media has a responsibility to present information without bias, and let their viewers decide their own opinions.
